# 🌧️ Rainfall Prediction using Linear Regression

This project predicts rainfall using **Linear Regression** based on historical weather data. The goal is to build a simple machine learning model that takes meteorological parameters as input and predicts rainfall with reasonable accuracy.  

## 🚀 Features
- Data preprocessing and cleaning  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations  
- Linear Regression model for prediction  
- Evaluation using metrics such as **R² Score** and **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**  
- Easy-to-use Jupyter Notebook implementation  

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset contains weather-related features like:  
- Temperature  
- Humidity  
- Wind Speed  
- Atmospheric Pressure  
- Rainfall (Target variable)  



## 🛠️ Requirements
Install the following Python libraries:
git clone https://github.com/Solitaryseeker/Rainfall-Prediction-using-Linear-Regression.git
cd Rainfall-Prediction-using-Linear-Regression

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
